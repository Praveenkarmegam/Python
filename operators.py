# 1. Arthimetic Operators - Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Modulus, Exponent, Floor Division

a = 10
b = 3

print("Addition:",a + b)
print("Subtraction:",a - b)
print("Multiplication:",a * b)
print("Division:",a / b)
print("Modulus:",a % b) #  Remainder - value after division is called as modulus
print("Exponent:",a ** b) # power value 
print("Floor Division:",a // b) # Quotient - value before decimal point is called as quotient

# 2. Assignment Operators - equal to, add and equal to, subtract and equal to, multiply and equal to, 
# divide and equal to, modulus and equal to, exponent and equal to, floor division and equal to

x  = 10
