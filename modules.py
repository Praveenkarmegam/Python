# Modules - structured programming approach

# import numpy as np  # library for numerical computations
# import pandas as pd # library for data manipulation, cleaning  and analysis
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # library for data visualization
# import seaborn as sns # library for statistical data visualization
# import keras # library for deep learning
# import sklearn # library for machine learning
# import tensorflow as tf # library for machine learning and deep learning

# A simple module, calc.py
# This module contains basic arithmetic operations - assumed as a calculator
